# Task
This project analyzes how market sentiment (Fear vs Greed) influences trader performance on Hyperliquid.
I examined metrics like Profit & Loss (PnL), win rate, and leverage to uncover behavioral patterns.
Then, I used correlation analysis (Pearson and Spearman) to measure how strongly sentiment relates to trader results.
Finally, I trained a predictive model to see if sentiment can forecast whether a day will be profitable.
The results help identify how emotional market conditions affect trading outcomes.
